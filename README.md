# Fire-Fighting-Robot

* According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), it is estimated that more than 1.2 lakh deaths have been caused because of fire accidents in India from 2010-2014.
* To rescue people and to put out the fire we are forced to use human resources which are not safe.
* With the advancement of technology especially in ROBOTICS it is very much possible to replace humans with robots for fighting the fire.
* This would improve the efficiency of firefighters and would also prevent them from risking human lives.
